# Code Book

This code book is for data created for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

## Raw Data

The original data and its description can be found here:

Please refer to the above sources to find out more about the original data set (a good starting point is the Readme.txt file).

## Data transformation

The transformation from raw data is done by running script run_analysis.R in this repo. Its output is a tidy data set containing average values of variables for each activity/subject pair.

The following steps have been performed during transformation:

1. Merging of raw train and test data sets

2. Adding subject_id and activity to each data point

3. Assign column names to data set (using original feature names from raw data set as well as 'activity' and 'subject_id' for the two columns added in the previous step)

4. Delete all columns containing measures not related to the mean or standard deviation

5. Create tidy data set by averaging over each variable for each given activity/subject_id combination

## Data set description

activity	String value detailing the type of activity, such as 'WALKING' OR 'SITTING'
subject_id	Integer value ranging from 1-30 identifying which subject was doing the activity

In addition, the following variables are average values of numeric measurements for the given activity/subject_id combination:
